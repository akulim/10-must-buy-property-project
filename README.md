# DigiLABS-Project
Notes:
This repository include 3-4 projects that I have done in the Data Science Workshop by DigiLABS Singapore x Code for ASIA. 
The projects are all done in group, but I am trying to modify it in my own way.

## Property in Melbourne, Australia
The dataset can be downloaded <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot">here</a>. <br>
From the workshop, we could choose our own objective, and my team chose to focus on the must-buy property in Melbourne, Australia, where our audience is the investor. <br>
In the presentation that uploaded here, I tried different approach, which based on the region with the nearest distance, first, and then the type of the most-sold property. <br>
Then, I match the criteria of the most-sold property to the available property. <br>
Lastly, the top 10 must-buy property is filtered by its distance and price.
