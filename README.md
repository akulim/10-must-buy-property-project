# "10 Must-Buy Property in Melbourne, Australia" Project
This repository includes the first project that I have done in the Data Science Foundational Workshop by DigiLABS Singapore x Code for ASIA. 
<br>
The projects are all done in group, but it is modified in the representation and steps.

## The Must-Buy Property in Melbourne, Australia
The dataset can be downloaded <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot">here</a>. <br>
The objective is to focus on the must-buy properties in Melbourne, Australia, with our target audience is the investor. <br>
In the presentation that uploaded here, I tried different approach. <br>
* First, it is based on the region with the nearest distance to the CBD area, and then the type of the most-sold property in that region. <br>
* Then, I match the criteria of the most-sold properties to the available properties. <br>
* Lastly, the available properties which matched with the criteria is filtered by distance and price.
